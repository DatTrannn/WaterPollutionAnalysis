# WaterPollutionAnalysis
The purpose of this report is to provide our findings, recommendations and solutions to relevant water quality research institutions through data mining. Provide effective solutions and accurate statistics for severely polluted areas. 

Our team has used Weka data mining software for data description, data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction, data modelling and other methods to conduct in-depth research on data. Through k-MEAN and DBSCAN studies, we find that water pollution is closely related to national population density. The higher the population density, the more serious the water pollution. To understand the impact and harm of water pollution on our daily life, and put forward our team's suggestions and methods for the areas with serious water pollution. Because we cherish the principle of protecting the ecology and maintaining the healthy life of the river
